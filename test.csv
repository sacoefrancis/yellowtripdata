Nothing breaks the flow of development more than having to wait a minute or two before getting feedback on the last code changes. Unfortunately, with applications growing in size and complexity, the popular build tools for front-end pipelines are often not fast enough anymore. Previously, we featured <a href=""/radar/tools/esbuild"">esbuild</a>, which offers a significant performance improvement, because it's implemented in a compile-to-native language rather than JavaScript. <strong><a href=""https://vitejs.dev/"">Vite</a></strong>, which is built on top of esbuild, delivers <a href=""https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html"">significant improvements</a> over other tools. It consists of two major parts: a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, such as extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and a build command that bundles your code with Rollup. Vite relies on ES modules, and unlike most older tools, it doesn't provide shimming or polyfills, which means it's not compatible with older browsers that don't support ES modules. In cases where older browsers had to be supported, some of our teams used Vite during development and other tools for production builds.</p>"
